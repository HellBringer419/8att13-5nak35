Enjoy the war of space as you and your rival bet their snakes to eat the most among 10  bits of food and emerge as a Battle Champion : Battle Snakes 

This game is 2 player but on a single system (yup, single keyboard). Just an idea to play dual player small games without internet or connectivity (in-general). 

Download The Resources folder and the BattleSnakes.jar jar-file. Run the following command (on terminal):
$ java -jar BattleSnakes.jar

Help is provided in the game.
